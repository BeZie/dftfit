# Potentials

A list of potentials that are supported by dftfit. If you can write
your potential in one of the following forms. DFTFIT can optimize it.



# Tersoff Potentials

Parameters: m, gamma, lambda3, c, d, costheta0, n, beta, lambda2, B, R, D, lambda1, A


# Stillinger Weber Potentials

Parameters: epsilon, sigma, a, lambda, gamma, cosheta0, A, B, p, q, tol
